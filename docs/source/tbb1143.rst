TBB1143
=======

This is yet another one of my Tiny Tapeout 2 designs, but this one is here because the original did not work (I messed up the ring oscillator). So I put it onto this die just out of frustration and just wanting to see this design work.

Additionally, this design was put together almost entirely in Logisim Evolution, which should make it a first for GFMPW.

For more information, see the original repo: `tt2-avalonsemi-TBB1143 <https://github.com/AvalonSemiconductors/tt2-avalonsemi-TBB1143>`__

Note: unlike the original TBB1143, no ring oscillator is here. DCLK is used to generate both the fast and slow clocks. DCLK rate must be equal to 256 times the desired sample clock and is also what is used when calculating channel frequencies.
