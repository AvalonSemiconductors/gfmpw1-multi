Diceroll
========

This is a resubmission of a Tiny Tapeout 2 project of mine, only on here as a reminder of where I started. The design needs to have a single 7-segment display connected to it and has a single input for a push button: ``ROLL``. When ``ROLL`` is activated, an animation of numbers "rolling" across the display is played before eventually settling on a random number. The decimal point illuminates to indicate that the animation has finished.

The RNG is a simple LFSR that is always shifting, even when the animation isnâ€™t playing. So the sequence depends on the exact time intervals between button presses and should therefor be different each time.
